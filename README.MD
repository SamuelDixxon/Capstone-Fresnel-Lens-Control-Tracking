# ECEN Capstone Fresnel Lens Control Tracking Team #66

This is the repository that contains all the work done on the capstone project for Team 66.
The world is rapidly transitioning its change from renewable to non-renewable energy sources.
The idea behind this project was to help our sponsor develop an IoT based solution to use motors
for a fresnel lens to track the sun. In the broader scope, this lens focussing element will be 
utilized in a larger thermo-chemical conntrol system where energy can be captured from the sun 
and stored for future use.
