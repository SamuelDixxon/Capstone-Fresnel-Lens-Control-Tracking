    <string name="Paragraph1">\tThe Purpose of this app is to provide system metrics and data visualization for our senior capstone project involving a tracking control system for a lightweight helio stat mirror system in real time.
        This is done by transmitting sensor data received by an Arduino Mega via bluetooth to the android device, storing the data into a web database, and giving the option to query historical data.

    <string name="Paragraph2">\tThe way energy is being produced in the world is changing quickly from non-renewable energy sources, such as gas and coal, to more sustainable sources, such as solar or wind energy.
    As a natural consequence, systems that channel harness renewable energy are receiving more attention and refining. A helio stat mirror control system is the system this project intends to improve. The focus for this project is to obtain a smaller helio stat, which sustains more localized used in suburban areas, while reducing the load required from the electric power grid</string>
